- Platform where you will find agricultural products for raw material and for consumption.

* We are an application that connects Colombian farmers with consumers and organizations that require products as raw material, to facilitate the sale of agricultural products (in deterioration or that do not meet the aesthetic standards of the market) and thus reduce food loss in agricultural production, waste of resources used and cost overruns for the productive sector, contributing to the economy of consumption.

# The privilege of feeding ourselves and not wasting!


## Why?

<p align="center">
  In Colombia, 9.7 tons of food are lost every year because they do not meet the aesthetic standards of the market or suffer deterioration before being marketed. 40% of the food that is lost is in agricultural production, equivalent to 3.8 million tons per year in Colombia, due to the lack of supply plans that put in “a balance the supply and demand” to not overproduce, in addition to the shortage of tertiary routes or good condition of the roads for food transportation.
</p>
<p align="center">
 This situation not only generates a considerable waste of food fit for consumption, but also implies a waste of the resources used in its production, such as land, water, energy and agricultural inputs. In addition, the loss of these products generates cost overruns for farmers, who see their income reduced because they are unable to sell their entire harvest.
</p>
<p align="center">
  Despite the nutritional quality of many of these products, the lack of adequate marketing and distribution channels means that large quantities of food end up being discarded. This not only affects the economy of the agricultural sector, but also has a negative impact on environmental sustainability by increasing CO2 emissions and other waste derived from unconsumed production.
</p>
<p align="center">
 Also, social organizations and companies that could take advantage of these products as raw material, either for human consumption or for other uses such as composting, face difficulties in accessing them due to the lack of a platform that facilitates direct connection with farmers.
</p>

## What is this our application for?

<p align="center">
  In this context, the need arises to develop a web application to connect Colombian farmers with consumers and organizations interested in acquiring these agricultural products. This platform would facilitate the sale of products that, although they do not meet aesthetic standards, are suitable for consumption or can be used as raw material. By reducing food loss, optimizing the use of resources and reducing cost overruns for farmers, the application will contribute to a more sustainable and efficient consumer economy, improving the accessibility of food at lower prices for consumers and promoting social and environmental responsibility.
</p>

## Who is it for?

<p align="center">
 Our application is aimed at farmers in the Antioquia region who have agricultural production surpluses that are likely to be lost because they do not meet commercial standards. It is also aimed at consumers and companies that can make use of these products, such as jam producers, livestock farmers, composting companies and fertilizer manufacturers, among others. The platform facilitates the sale and use of these products as raw material, promoting sustainability and reducing food waste.
